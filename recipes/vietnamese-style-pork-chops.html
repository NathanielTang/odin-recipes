    <p>
      This is a recipe for Vietnamese style pork chops that I have made
      following a few different youtube videos. Although the original recipe is
      <em>grilled</em>
      , my recipe is cooked on a stovetop using a cast iron pan on high heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ingredients used to marinate the pork chops can be substituted or omitted
      depending on what you have. Use your own judgment! If you don't have fish
      sauce, use more soy sauce. If you don't have honey, add more sugar.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        about 4-6 medium sized pork chops (I <em>think</em> I like bone-in more)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Five spice (1/4 tsp)</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder (1 tsp)</li>
      <li>Black pepper (1/2 tsp)</li>
      <li>Sugar (1tsp)</li>
      <li>Paprika (1/2tsp)</li>
      <li>Fish sauce (2tbsp)</li>
      <li>Soy sauce (2tbsp)</li>
      <li>Sesame oil (1tbsp; optional)</li>
      <li>
        Cooking oil (1tbsp or 2tbsp if not using sesame oil; a neutral oil would
        probably work best, haven't tested though)
      </li>
      <li>honey (3tbsp; can use syrup)</li>
      <li>Hoisin sauce (2tbsp; can use BBQ sauce as well)</li>
      <li>
        Lemongrass (3tbsp; if you can't get lemongrass, I've found that dried
        basil kind of works! Add some lime zest as well if you have that handy)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    >
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix all the ingredients for the marinade together. The amounts are just
        guidelines, but please feel free to adjust to your personal tastes or to
        ingredients that you have.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate the pork chops for at least 30 mins. Letting it sit for longer
        should make it better but it's hard to be patient!
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook, get your cast iron pan hot. Then, add oil and get
        ready to cook those chops!
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your chops and
        whether they are bone-in or not. Best practice if you're unsure of
        cooking time is probably to use a thermometer. I believe most guidelines
        in North America say to get the internal temperature of pork to at least
        160 F, but please check and confirm that. <br />
        These pork chops can burn easily because of all the sugars in the
        marinade, so please be careful. Personally, I think a bit of charring
        adds to the flavour.

        I like to serve on a bed of white rice along with some of this
