        >Description: This sauce is sweet, savoury, spicy, and a little pungent.
        It's delicious with rice, veggies, meat, and noodles. I absolutely adore
        it! Source: from a recipe on allrecipes.com, by "Calamity in the

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is very simple, but the resutls are amazing. <br />
      It goes very well with
      <a href="../recipes/vietnamese-style-pork-chops.html">this</a>. I fell in
      love with this sauce while eating at Vietnamese restaurants. Particularly
      at Pho place. This sauce is served with meats and spring rolls, as well as
      vermecelli noodle salads. Those vermecelli noodle salads are what really
      got me to fall in love with this sauce.

        This recipe is very simple. Follow this following ratio for the sugar,
        water, and fish sauce. 1:5:1 That is, one part sugar, five parts water,
        and one part fish sauce. I've seen some recipes call for warm water, but
        I haven't had any trouble with just room temperature water. It shouldn't
        hurt though! So, for example, you could have 1 tbsp sugar, 5 tbsp water,
        and 1 tbsp fish sauce. Adjust according to taste, as always.

      <li>
        Add lime juice, minced garlic, and sliced Thai bird's eye chiles. Add
        these all to taste. <strong>Be careful</strong> with the chiles, as they
        can be <em>very hot</em>. I really like the flavour that they add, but
        the heat can be overwhelming! You can try to get the seeds out to reduce
        the heat. Also, remember if you touched these chiles with your hands,
        <strong>DO NOT</strong> touch your face or any other sensitive areas.
